<h1> galeforce</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
galeforce is an anime recommendation website. Specifically, users will be able to register an account with the website and then rate shows that they have seen. After rating several (5~10) shows, the user will see customized recommendations generated by the siteâ€™s recommendation algorithm. 

The site will provide toplists for users; that is, a list of all shows sorted by ranking, popularity, etc. Users will be able to search for shows and see a list of results that match the query across several dimensions (director, cast, staff, genre, title, tags). Users will also be able to filter both toplists and search results based on specific criteria including first air date, last air date, genre, staff, and tags.
