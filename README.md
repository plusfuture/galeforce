<h1> galeforce</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
galeforce is an anime recommendation website. Specifically, users will be able to register an account with the website and then rate shows that they have seen. After rating several (5~10) shows, the user will see customized recommendations generated by the siteâ€™s recommendation algorithm. 

The site will provide toplists for users; that is, a list of all shows sorted by ranking, popularity, etc. Users will be able to search for shows and see a list of results that match the query across several dimensions (director, cast, staff, genre, title, tags). Users will also be able to filter both toplists and search results based on specific criteria including first air date, last air date, genre, staff, and tags.


<h2>Data Model</h2>

  First draft schema:
  
    // users
    // * our site requires authentication...
    // * so users have a username and password
    // * they also can have 0 or more lists to keep track of loved ones' sleep schedules too
    // * (even though I think it is weird to log on others' sleep schedule )
    var User = new mongoose.Schema({
        //username, password provided by plugin
        shows: [String]
    });

    // shows have a bunch of information about them, as listed out in the schema
    // users who rated is a list of usernames
    var Show = new mongoose.Schema({
        name: String,
        ratings: [Number],
        avgRating: Number,
        usersWhoRated: [String],
        synposis: String,
        dateBegin: Date,
        dateEnd: Date
    });

<h2>User Stories</h2>
>1. As a user, I can express my views and rate shows I've seen.
>2. As a user, I can view other shows that are recommended to me based on this rating.
>3. As a user, I can use galeforce to discover new shows that I'll love.


<h2>Research Topics</h2>
>1. Integrate user authentication (6 points)
..* User authentication enables users to maintain their own personal set of ratings, and be shown custom recommendations based off of those ratings. Authentication is also important to protect user privacy. Some possible modules are PassportJS or Stormpath. I will be integrating user sign-up and login.
>2. Recommendation engine (6 points)
..* The recommendation engine is probably the single, most important feature of galeforce. The whole point of the site is to generate recommendations for users, so this part better be spectacular. Some possible modules are GER, Raccoon, likely, collaborative_filtering, mongoose-mlt, and recommend. Most likely it will be a one collaborative filtering algorithm and one bag-of-words algorithm for 0-day recommendations.
